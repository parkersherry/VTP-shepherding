% TARGET
% Defines the target class for implementation of VTP
%
% tar = Target()
%           defines an empty Target, that is, tar.Components and tar.ids
%           are the empty cell array and empty array, respectively.
% tar = Target(P)
%           where P is a 2-column matrix defines a Target with a single
%           component whose veritices are the rows of P. P is taken to
%           represent a point, segment, or (closed) polygon, depending on
%           the number of rows.
% tar = Target(C) 
%           where C is a cell array of size k where each C{:} is a 2-column
%           matrix defines a target with k components specified by the C{:}
%           as above.
% tar = Target(_,ids)
%           where ids is a vector sets tar.Components exactly as above but
%           also sets tar.Ids to ids. the length of ids must match the
%           number of components. The purpose is to associate distinct
%           components into unions effectively creating subtargets which
%           may be sought by distinct subpopulations. (See the homeToTarget
%           method.)
% Notes:
%   - If P = C{i} in the above syntaxes, then the i-th cell of
%     tar.Components contains:
%       - P itself if P has only one or two rows;
%       - polyshape(P) if P has at least three rows.
%   - homeToTarget may give unexpected results if the target has nonconvex
%     components.
%   - homeToTarget may give unexpected results if the target has
%     overlapping components with the same id.
